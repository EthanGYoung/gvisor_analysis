# Why gVisor?

gVisor makes a different set of technical trade-offs compared to existing
sandbox technologies, thus providing new tools and ideas for the container
security landscape.

As the developers of gVisor, we wanted an execution environment that was secure,
simple, and lightweight and were able to make trade offs in other areas. We were
not able to achieve that with existing solutions.
