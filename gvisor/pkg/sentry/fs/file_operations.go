// FileOperations are operations on a File that diverge per file system.
//
// Operations that take a *File may use only the following interfaces:
//
// - File.UniqueID:	Operations may only read this value.
// - File.Dirent:	Operations must not take or drop a reference.
// - File.Offset(): 	This value is guaranteed to not change for the
//			duration of the operation.
// - File.Flags():	This value may change during the operation.
