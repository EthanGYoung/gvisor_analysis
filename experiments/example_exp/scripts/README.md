# Scripts

This folder is meant to hold scripts for invoking this experiment. The intent is for the scripts to be invoked directly in this folder and will be able to run to completion.

List all of the scripts in this folder and their intended usage.

Ex) Script1.py <num_cpus> <log_location> -> generates the number of virtual cpu's that you specify

Note: May be worthwhile to have a log_location parameter for all tests so can save logs to the right location. Saves as experimentX.log to that location.
